Overview: The Newton Raphson Method is a root finding method that uses a function and the first derivative of that function to find the root. The Matlab code is not a function
file, but it operates in a similar way.

Inputs: x=initial guess, f=function, i= number of iterations (must put 1:n with n being the number of iterations) <br />
Outputs: The value of x that comes out will be the root based on the number of iterations.

Limitations: Function must differentiable and user must pick an initial guess relatively close to the root.
